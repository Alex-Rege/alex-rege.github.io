      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an applied mathematician working on models in kinetic theory. I am particularly interested in models for magnetized plasmas, such as the magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system and the Vlasov-Maxwell system. From 2021 to 2024, I was a postdoc at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zürich under the supervision of [Mikaela Iacobelli](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~imikaela/home). Before this I was a PhD student working at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.fr/) in Paris under the supervision of [Bruno Després](https://www.ljll.fr/despres/) and [Frédérique Charles](https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Frederique.Charles/). Here is my [PhD manuscript](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03406651/document) and the [slides of my defense](uploads/soutenance.pdf).
