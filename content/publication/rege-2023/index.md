abstract: We present two results regarding the three-dimensional Vlasov--Poisson system in the full space with an external magnetic field.  First, we investigate the propagation of velocity moments for solutions to the system when the magnetic field is uniform and time-dependent. We combine the classical moment approach with an induction procedure depending on the cyclotron period $T_c=||B||_{\infty}^{-1}$. This allows us to obtain, like in the unmagnetized case, the propagation of velocity moments of order $k>2$ in the full space case and of order $k>3$ in the periodic case. Second, this time taking a general magnetic field that depends on both time and position, we manage to extend a result by Miot regarding uniqueness for Vlasov--Poisson to the magnetized framework.
