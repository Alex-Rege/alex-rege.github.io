abstract: We show propagation of moments in velocity for the 3-dimensional Vlasov--Poisson system with a uniform magnetic field $B=(0,0,\omega)$ by adapting the work of Lions, Perthame. The added magnetic field also produces singularities at times which are the multiples of the cyclotron period $t=\frac{2\pi k}{\omega}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. This result also allows to show propagation of regularity for the solution. For uniqueness, we extend Loeper's result by showing that the set of solutions with bounded macroscopic density is a uniqueness class.
