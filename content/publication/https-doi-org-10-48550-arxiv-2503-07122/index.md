abstract: We investigate the stability of solutions to the Vlasov--Poisson system using the unifying framework of the kinetic Wasserstein distance, introduced by Iacobelli in (Section 4 in *Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.* 244  (2022), no. 1, 27-50). This allows us to treat both macroscopic densities that lie in a Yudovich space, as recently considered by Crippa et al. (Theorem 1.6 in *Nonlinearity* 37 (2024), no. 9, 095015) for the $1$-Wasserstein distance, and higher order Wasserstein distances, for which only bounded macroscopic densities were treated by Iacobelli and the first author (Theorem 1.11 in *Bull. Lond. Math. Soc.* 56 (2024), 2250-2267). First, we establish an $L^p$-estimate on the difference between two force fields in terms of a suitable nonlinear quantity that controls the kinetic Wasserstein distance between their macroscopic densities. Second, we use this estimate in order to derive a closable Osgood-type inequality for the kinetic Wasserstein distance between two solutions. This enables us to prove our main theorem; for $1 \le p < +\infty$ we show the $p$-Wasserstein stability of solutions to the Vlasov--Poisson system with macroscopic densities belonging to a Yudovich space.
